<h2>1. Data Protection</h2>
We appreciate you visiting our website and your interest in the products we offer. Protecting your personal data is very important to us. In this Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect your personal information, what we do with it, for what purposes and on what legal foundation we do so, and what rights you have on that basis. We will also refer you to Strada-Benz's Data Protection Policy:

Strada-Auto Data Protection Policy

Our Privacy Statement on the use of our websites and the Strada-Benz Group AG Data Protection Policy do not apply to your activities on the websites of social networks or other providers that can be accessed using the links on our websites. Please read the data protection provisions on the websites of those providers.
<br><br><br><br>
<h2>2. Collecting and Processing Your Personal Data</h2>
a. Whenever you visit our websites, we store certain information about the browser and operating system you are using; the date and time of your visit; the status of the interaction (e.g. whether you were able to access the website or received an error message); the usage of features on the website; any search phrases you entered; how often you visit individual websites; the names of the files you access; the amount of data transferred; the Web page from which you accessed our website; and the Web page you visited after visiting our website, whether by clicking links on our websites or entering a domain directly into the input field of the same tab (or window) of the browser in which you have our websites open. In addition, we store your IP address and the name of your Internet service provider for seven days. This is for security reasons; in particular, to prevent and detect attacks on our websites or attempts at fraud.

b. We only store other personal data if you provide this data, e.g. as part of a registration, contact form, chat, survey, price competition competition or for the execution of a contract, and even in these cases only insofar as this is permitted to us on the basis of a consent given by you or in accordance with the applicable legal provisions (see section 7).

c. You are neither legally nor contractually obligated to share your personal information. However, certain features of our websites may depend on the sharing or personal information. If you do not provide your personal information in such cases, you may not be able to use those features, or they may be available with limited functionality.
<br><br><br><br>
<h2>3. Purposes of Use</h2>
a. We use the personal information collected during your visit to any of our websites to make using them as convenient as possible for you and to protect our IT systems against attacks and other unlawful activities.

b. If you share additional information with us – for example, by filling out a registration form, contact form, chat, survey, contest entry or to execute a contract with you – we will use that information for the designated purposes, purposes of customer management and – if required – for purposes of processing and billing and business transactions within the required scope in each instance.

c. For more information about the data sharing between Strada-Auto Egypt S.A.E, Strada-Benz AG, Strada-Benz Mobility AG for the purpose of analysis and marketing please click here. This refers to activities on this specific Strada-Benz website only in case you have granted consent for this purpose and data sharing with Strada-Benz AG and Strada-Benz Mobility AG.

d. In addition, we use personal data to the extent that we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., storage for the fulfillment of commercial or tax-related retention obligations, release in accordance with official or judicial orders, e.g. to a law enforcement authority).
<br><br><br><br>
<h2>4. Transfer of Personal Information to Third Parties; Social Plugins; Use of Service Providers</h2>
a. Our websites may also contain an offer of third parties. If you click on such an offer, we transfer data to the respective provider to the required extent (e.g. information that you have found this offer with us and, if applicable, further information that you have already provided on our websites for this purpose).

b. When we use social plug-ins on our websites from social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, we integrate them as follows:
When you visit our websites, the social plug-ins are deactivated, i.e. no data is transmitted to the operators of these networks. If you want to use one of the networks, click on the respective social plug-in to establish a direct connection to the server of the respective network.
If you have a user account on the network and are logged in when you activate the social plug-in, the network can associate your visit to our websites with your user account. If you want to avoid this, please log out of the network before activating the social plug-in.
A social network cannot associate a visit to other Strada-Benz websites until you have activated an existing social plug-in.
When you activate a social plug-in, the network transfers the content that becomes available directly to your browser, which integrates it into our websites. In this situation, data transmissions can also take place that are initiated and controlled by the respective social network. Your connection to a social network, the data transfers taking place between the network and your system, and your interactions on that platform are governed solely by the privacy policies of that network.
The social plug-in remains active until you deactivate it or delete your cookies (see section 5.d).

c. If you click on the link to an offer or activate a social plug-in, Personal data may reach providers in countries outside Egypt that, from the point of view of the Personal Data Protection Law No. 151 of 2020 may not guarantee an "adequate level of protection" for the processing of personal data in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Law No. 151 of 2020 standards. Please remember this fact before clicking on a link or activating a social plug-in and thereby triggering a transfer of your data.

d. We also use qualified service providers (e.g., IT service providers, marketing agencies) to operate, optimize and secure our web-sites. We only pass on personal data to the latter insofar as this is necessary for the provision and use of the website and its functionalities, for the pursuit of legitimate interests, to comply with legal obligations, or insofar as you have consented there to (see section 7). You will find more information regarding recipients of personal data in our consent management system here.

For more information about the data sharing between Strada-Auto Egypt S.A.E, Strada-Auto AG, Strada-Benz Mobility AG for the purpose of analysis and marketing please click here.
This refers to activities on this specific Strada-Benz website only in case you have granted consent for this purpose and data sharing with Strada-Benz AG and Strada-Benz Mobility AG.

<br><br><br><br>
<h2>7. Legal Foundations for Processing</h2>
a. If you have given us your consent to process your personal information, then that is the legal foundation for processing it (the Personal Data Protection Law No. 151 of 2020 (“PDPL”)).

c. If processing your personal information is required to fulfill our legal obligations (e.g. data retention), we are authorized to do so by Article 6, clause No. 3, of the PDPL.

d. Furthermore, we process personal information for purposes of protecting our legitimate interests as well as the interests of third parties in accordance with Article 6, clause No. 4 of the PDPL. Examples of such legitimate interests include maintaining the functionality of our IT systems as well as the (direct) marketing of our products and services (to the extent not covered by your consent) and those of third parties and the legally required documentation of business contacts. As part of the consideration of interests required in each case, we take into account various aspects, in particular the type of personal information, the purpose of processing, the circumstances of processing and your interest in the confidentiality of your personal information.
<br><br><br><br>
<h2>8. Deleting Your Personal Data</h2>
Your IP address and the name of your Internet service provider, which we store for security reasons, are deleted after seven days. Moreover, we delete your personal information as soon as the purpose for which it was collected and processed has been fulfilled. Beyond this time period, data storage only takes place to the extent made necessary by the legislation, regulations or other legal provisions to which we are subject in the PDPL or by legal provisions in third-party countries if these have an appropriate level of data protection. Should it not be possible to delete data in individual cases, the relevant personal data are flagged to restrict their further processing.

As a data subject affected by data processing, you have the right to information (Article 2 clause No. 1 of the PDPL), Correction (Article 2 clause No. 3 of the PDPL), Deletion (Article 2 clause No. 3 of the PDPL), Restricted processing (Article 2 clause No. 6) and Data Transferability (Article 2 clause No. 4).

b. If you have consented to the processing of your personal information by us, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time. Your revocation does not affect the legality of the processing of your personal information that took place before your consent was revoked. It also has no effect on the continued processing of the information on another legal basis, such as to fulfill legal obligations (see section titled "Legal Foundation of Processing").

c. Right to object
For reasons relating to your particular situation, you have the right to file an objection at any time to the processing of personal data pertaining to you that is collected under Article 6 Clause clause No. 2 of the PDPL or a) Article 6 clause No. 4 of the PDPL.
